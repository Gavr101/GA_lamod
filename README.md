# General Description
This project implements a genetic algorithm with binary encoding, as well as three of its gender modifications described in the article "Study of Modifications of Gender Genetic Algorithm" (http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-44865-2_30).

Results of their application to model problems:

In the directory <GA_1hc>, a toy example is implemented for solving the 1-hot-coding problem.

In the directory <Ackley_model_task>, a solution to the optimization problem of the Ackley function is implemented using four types of genetic algorithms.

# Genetic Algorithms
The implementation does not use third-party packages.
Directory hierarchy:

0) Base directories: <GA_kernal_lib> â†’ <GGA_kernal_lib>;
1) Gender modifications: <GGA_MS_kernal_lib>, <GGA_MM_kernal_lib>, <GGA_MMS_kernal_lib>;
2) Specification of the optimization problem being solved. Implemented at the final stage. Examples: <GA_1hc>, <Ackley_model_task>.
